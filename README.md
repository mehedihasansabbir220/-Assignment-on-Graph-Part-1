# Graph Assignment

This repository contains solutions to two graph-related problems. The tasks are solved using JavaScript and focus on DFS/BFS algorithms.

## Task 1: Valid Path in a Graph

### Problem:
Given a bi-directional graph, determine if a valid path exists between a source and a destination vertex.

### Solution Approach:
- Build the graph using an adjacency list.
- Use BFS to search for a path from the source to the destination.

### Time Complexity:
- O(n + edges.length)

### Space Complexity:
- O(n + edges.length)

## Task 2: Number of Connected Components in a Graph

### Problem:
Given a graph, find the number of connected components.

### Solution Approach:
- Build the graph using an adjacency list.
- Perform DFS/BFS to explore all connected components.

### Time Complexity:
- O(A + |B|)

### Space Complexity:
- O(A + |B|)

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the JavaScript files to test the solutions.
